# Hand over files

Hand over a file, or files to friends.

```
npm i node-handover -g
```

Then:

```
handover [file1.txt file2.zip ...]
```

This will copy the files to our download directory. Spin up a small webserver. Tunnel out to the internet and serve the files to download. Watch the terminal for the download link.

Share the link with friends and they can download the files direct from your computer. No software required on their end, and no uploading to the cloud.

Huge thanks to localtunnel.me for providing a service that makes this possible!
